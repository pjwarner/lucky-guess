**Lucky Guess Standings**

{score_board}

#If I missed your vote please send me a PM.

**Comments must include:**

* Final Score (winner must be specified)
* Tiebreaker question
* Format: [Score] [Winner] [Tiebreaker]

**All guesses must be submitted by the posted start time to qualify.** 

**Scoring will be as follows:**

* Exact guess = 6 points.   
* Off by one run = 1 point.   
* In the event of a tie, the loser of the tiebreaker scores 2 points. 

**If two users pick the same score with the same tiebreaker, the person who submitted their guess first will be awarded the 6 points. The same rule will apply when two tiebreakers guess are equally close to the actual result.**

**Scores will be tallied each night and submitted to the post-game thread. They will also appear in the "Standings" section of future Lucky Guess posts.**

#Now let's play ball!
##Game time is {game_time}.  Submissions made after this time will not be counted.
##Tiebreaker for today is {tie_breaker}

# Reminder: do not edit your comment. If you need to change your guess, delete your comment and submit a new guess.
